      <span style=" font-family: 'Arial Black', Gadget, sans-serif; font-size: 25px; ">Instructions:</span>
      <br><br>
      1. Brew a pot of strong coffee, using your preferred coffee blend and brewing method.
      <br><br>
      2. In a heat-resistant glass or an Irish Coffee mug, add a teaspoon of brown sugar (optional) to enhance the sweetness of the drink.
      <br><br>
      3. Pour hot coffee into the glass, filling it about three-quarters full.
      <br><br>
      4. Add a shot (about 1.5 ounces) of Irish whiskey to the coffee, adjusting the amount to your taste preference.
      <br><br>
      5. Stir the coffee and whiskey together until the sugar (if used) is fully dissolved.
      <br><br>
      6. Hold a spoon upside down over the coffee, close to the surface, and gently pour the whipped cream over the back of the spoon.
      <br><br>
      7. The cream should float on top of the coffee, creating a distinct layer.
      <br><br>
      8. Optionally, you can garnish the whipped cream with a sprinkle of coffee grounds or cocoa powder.
      <br><br>
      9. Serve the Irish Coffee immediately, and enjoy the wonderful contrast of flavors as you sip through the creamy layer to the rich coffee and whiskey beneath.
      <br>
      <br><br>
      Irish Coffee offers a delightful blend of comforting warmth and soothing creaminess, making it a perfect treat for special occasions or a cozy night in.
