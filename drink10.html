      <br><br>
      Cold brew coffee is made by slowly steeping coarsely ground <u style="color: rgb(212, 31, 67)">coffee beans</u> in room temperature water for at least six hours (it can be as much as up to 24, but it depends on how strong you want your cold brew it to be, many choose to do it overnight). When the beans are steeped like this it creates a strong coffee concentrate that just needs to be mixed with water and milk to taste.

      <br>

      As the grounds aren’t exposed to hot temperatures, cold brew coffee has a more flavourful, sweeter and less bitter and acidic taste. In a recent study, cold brew coffee was found to be between 50 &#45; 67% less acidic than the average cup of coffee.

      It’s a common misbelief that cold brew has to be cold, in actual fact it can be served piping hot too! If you want it cold, simply add cold water, ice and milk (to taste) and for hot you just need to boil water or add hot milk (some will even pop it in the microwave if they’re in a rush).

      A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE COLD BREW COFFEE DRINK - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
    </p>

    <p class="drink-info1">
      Over the last ten years, cold brew coffee has skyrocketed in popularity and has revolutionized how we consume coffee.
      <br><br> 
      Cold brewed coffee is different from brewed coffee in 3 ways: it brews cold, brews for at least 14 hours, and is not bitter. Basically, it’s all the great parts of brewed coffee without the bitterness, sourness, and diluted flavor. So how did cold brew become so popular? The history of cold brew starts in Japan.
