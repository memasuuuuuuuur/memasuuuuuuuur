      <br>
      <br>
      An Americano is an espresso drink much like <u style="color: rgb(212, 31, 67)">cappuccinos</u> and <u style="color: rgb(212, 31, 67)">lattes</u>. It is made entirely from espresso and water, giving it a similar consistency to drip coffee. Although it looks and smells like a drip coffee, Americanos actually have a very different flavor profile because of how they were brewed.

      <u style="color: rgb(212, 31, 67)">Espresso</u> <u style="color: rgb(212, 31, 67)">coffee</u> is made using a unique <u style="color: rgb(212, 31, 67)">brewing</u> <u style="color: rgb(212, 31, 67)">method</u> that provides the coffee with a stronger and more intense flavor. It is heavily aromatic and bold. Espresso’s flavor can be attributed to the hot pressurized water that is used to brew densely packed coffee grinds.

      <br>

      The metal filter of the <u style="color: rgb(212, 31, 67)">espresso</u> <u style="color: rgb(212, 31, 67)">machine</u> also adds to the flavor, differentiating it from all other types of brewing. Many Americans find that espresso is hard to drink by itself. Espresso can be very strong and bitter, but its harsh taste is mitigated with water. This is how the Americano was born.
  
      <br><br>
      
      <p class="drink-info1">
        The Americano combines bold espresso with water to dilute its intensity. Depending on where you order, an Americano contains anywhere from a third of a cup to a half of a cup of espresso. The rest is filled with water, which can be hot or iced according to preference.

      A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE AMERICANO COFFEE DRINK - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
    </p>

    <p class="drink-info1">
      Have you ever traveled, particularly in Italy, and seen “caffe Americano” listed as an option at a local coffee shop? While it literally translates to “American coffee,” it’s not just a sly way for Italians to charge American tourists more for out-of-the-can Folgers coffee. With origins in Europe, the “watered down” Americano is steeped in history.
      <br><br>
      During World War II, troops throughout Europe were rationing of all their favorite food and drinks. Luckily for the troops in Italy, Italians love their coffee as much as their wine. However, Americans had an issue with the coffee Italians made: it was very dark and very rich.
