      Instant coffee is made from real coffee beans. The soluble and volatile contents of the beans are extracted. Then the water is removed so powder or concentrated soluble coffee powder are left over. It’s essentially been dehydrated for our convenience – just add water and you have yourself a brew!

        Like most other coffees, instant coffee also comes in a variety of roasts: dark, medium and light, so you’re still able to choose the strength that you love. You might also be looking for the same rich flavour but without caffeine. Luckily, decaf instant coffee is here to satisfy your cravings with the same quick and easy process.

      A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE INSTANT COFFEE DRINK - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
    </p>

    <p class="drink-info1">     
      Instant coffee, though often dismissed by true coffee aficionados, is incredibly convenient, as drinkers need only their selected coffee powder and hot water to enjoy their beverage. Within seconds, the powder, which is extracted from actual green coffee beans that have been roasted and ground, turns into a drinkable roast without the need of a brewer, bean grinder, or any other coffee accessory. 
      <br><br>
      As modernized as instant coffee may sound, its origins actually span back to the American Civil War, as soldiers were looking for a fast and affordable way to spike their energy levels during combat. It was noted to have the consistency of axle grease and was reportedly rather detested amongst the troops. However, the idea stuck, and in 1901, the first successful method for creating a soluble coffee substance was discovered by Japanese American chemist Satori Kato.
