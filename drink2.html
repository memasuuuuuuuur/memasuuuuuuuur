      <br>
      <br>
      Kaleena Teoh, co-founder and director of education at <u style="color: rgb(212, 31, 67)">Coffee Project New York</u>, explains, "A cortado is basically a one-to-one ratio of espresso and steamed milk." At a typical specialty coffee shop, ordering a cortado means you'll get about two ounces of espresso and two ounces of milk, so roughly a four-ounce drink. It's smaller than many coffee shop favorites and Teoh describes the size as somewhere between an espresso macchiato and a flat white.

      A traditional cortado is unsweetened — the only ingredients are espresso and steamed milk, the latter of which lends a bit of sweetness from the milk sugars (some non-dairy milks are sweetened, while regular milk has natural sugars). For a sweeter drink, Teoh suggests a Cuban version of a cortado called the Cortadito, which is sweetened with either condensed milk or a bit of sugar. She calls it the perfect drink for someone who wants that balance of milk and espresso with more sweetness.

      <p class="drink-info1">
        A coffee cortado is simply a coffee made out of one part espresso and one part milk. The milk encompasses 50% of the drink so that the bitterness of the espresso is made more subtle and therefore drinkable.

        And it isn’t made with just any type of milk; instead, steamed milk is used to make a cortado. As most people know, espresso can be very acidic on the tongue. The steamed milk in a Cortado does a great job of making the coffee a lot less bitter and less acidic. It is easy to drink even for people who normally don’t like super-strong coffees.
        <br><br>
        Also called Spanish Gibraltar coffee, it is popular all over the world. While other Italian coffee drinks have frothy or foamy milk on top, a cortado has very little, if any, froth on the top.

    <p class="drink-info11">
      A cortado is a beverage consisting of espresso mixed with a roughly equal amount of warm milk to reduce the acidity,[1][2] although the exact ratios have considerable regional variation.[3] The milk in a cortado is steamed, but not frothy and "texturized" as in many Italian coffee drinks.[4] The cortado comes from Spain, most likely Madrid, where it is commonly served.[5] The word cortado is the past participle of the Spanish verb cortar (to cut), in the sense of "dilute", and can refer variously to either coffee or espresso drinks throughout Spanish and Portuguese speaking countries.

        Direction:
        <br>
        1. Grind the coffee beans to a fine consistency, suitable for espresso brewing.
        <br>
        2. Boil water to the desired temperature, typically between 195°F to 205°F (90°C to 96°C).
        <br>
        3. Prepare a shot of hot and freshly brewed espresso using an espresso machine.
        <br>
        4. Steam the milk using a milk frother until it reaches a velvety texture with small, fine bubbles.
        <br>
        5. Pour an equal amount of steamed milk into the espresso, ""cutting"" the coffee to achieve the ideal balance.
        <br>
        6. Sip and savor the exquisite taste and texture of the Cortado, where the boldness of espresso mingles harmoniously with the smoothness of steamed milk.
