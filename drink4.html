      <br>
      <br>
      The word “macchiato” derives from Italy, and it means “marked.” The coffee drink was named after this word because a shot of espresso is “marked” with some milk.

      <br>
      <br>

      Macchiatos are made in a way that’s very similar to other coffee drinks such as mochas, lattes, and cappuccinos, with the tying factor being that they are all made with espresso and milk.

      Macchiatos, however, are distinct from other coffee drinks, and macchiato lovers enjoy the difference.

    <p class="drink-info1">
      Like many other coffee drinks, the macchiato originated in Italy. It was originally created as an excuse to consume espresso in the middle of the day.
      <br><br>
      According to coffee experts, macchiato dates back to the 18th century in italy where it was created to distinguish black espresso from espresso with milk. Since it is not a universally known recipe, you’ll find many macchiato variants in cafes. For instance, a piccolo latte is an espresso drink containing espresso topped with foamed milk, whereas a caramel macchiato is made of steamed milk with some espresso, topped with a layer of caramel syrup. In Italy, macchiatos are commonly referred to as espresso macchiatos (caffè macchiatos). For latte macchiato, let your barista know ahead of time to prepare it for you.

        Direction:
        <br>
        1. <u>Make the espresso:</u> Grind about 16.5 grams of espresso roast coffee beans using a conical burr grinder. Prepare 2 shots of espresso using an espresso machine or manual espresso maker. Pour the espresso into a demitasse or macchiato cup.
        <br><br>
        2. <u>Froth the milk:</u>Heat the milk to 150 degrees Fahrenheit for frothing. Pour about ½ cup milk into the metal steaming pitcher and use the steam wand in the espresso machine or a milk frother, French press or whisk to froth milk into small, even bubbles with the texture of melted ice cream.
        <br><br>
        3. <u>Assemble the macchiato:</u>Top your shot of espresso with a dollop(about a half of an ounce) of the steamed milk to "stain" it. Serve and enjoy.
