      <br>
      <br>
      The Flat White is a popular and flavorful coffee beverage that originated in Australia and New Zealand. This espresso-based drink is known for its smooth and velvety texture, achieved by combining microfoam with a balanced amount of espresso. The Flat White strikes a perfect harmony between coffee strength and milk creaminess, offering a delightful coffee experience that has garnered global popularity.

      White coffees are essentially just black coffee with milk. A flat white is a smaller version of a latte that consists of two shots of a more concentrated and sweeter espresso made with less water. The velvety texture on top of this specialty coffee is a flat microfoam made out of full-fat steamed milk.

    </p>

    <p class="drink-info1">
      Since originating in Australia in the 1980s, the Flat White became a coffeehouse staple in the UK and is now a budding favorite among coffee aficionados in the United States and Canada. Starbucks customers in Australia have enjoyed the beverage in stores since 2009, and those in the UK since 2010.

      <br><br>

      The New Zealand Herald calls the flat white the “quintessential Kiwi coffee.” While Sydney coffee shops may have first served the drink in the 1980s, the Herald writes, Wellington is where the flat white was perfected.

        Direction:
        <br>
        1. Grind the coffee beans to a fine consistency, specifically calibrated for espresso brewing.
        <br>
        2. Boil water to the desired temperature, typically between 195°F to 205°F (90°C to 96°C).
        <br>
        3. Preheat your espresso cups to ensure the coffee stays warm.
        <br>
        4. Prepare a shot of hot and freshly brewed espresso using an espresso machine.
        <br>
        5. In a steaming pitcher, steam the milk using a milk frother to create a velvety and creamy microfoam. Aim for a texture that is silkier than traditional froth but denser than latte art foam.
        <br>
        6. Pour the steamed milk over the espresso shot, aiming to achieve a well-defined dot of creamy foam on top of the drink.
        <br>
        7. The Flat White is now ready to be enjoyed! Sip and savor the smooth and harmonious combination of espresso and microfoam.
