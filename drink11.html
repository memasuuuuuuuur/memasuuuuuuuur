      The term “drip coffee” may or may not be familiar to you, suffice it to say, I have no doubt that if you’ve ever drank coffee in your life, you’ve had drip coffee. Simply put, drip coffee is coffee that’s brewed by coffee makers. Getting a bit more into the particulars of it, you could technically say that something like a French press or a percolator is also a <u style="color: rgb(212, 31, 67)">coffee maker</u> , so in this context “drip coffee” will refer to coffee made by an automatic coffee maker, meaning a carafe and a basket full of ground coffee with water hot water dripped on it.

      Drip coffee is made by pouring boiling water over ground coffee (the grind of which being much coarser than espresso). A filter that is typically made from paper separates the grounds from the brewed liquid which allows the water to pass through and fall into a pot or jug. However, you can now also get coffee pots which are especially for drip coffee brewing or electric options which you can set timers on so you can choose what time it’s made.

    </p>

    <p class="drink-info1">
      The invention of drip coffee can be traced back to Melitta Bentz, a German housewife who, in 1908, created the first drip coffee maker. Dissatisfied with the taste and sediment left by traditional brewing methods, Bentz experimented with alternatives and eventually used blotting paper as a filter to separate the coffee grounds from the liquid. This revolutionary innovation provided a smoother, cleaner, and more aromatic coffee experience without sediments.
