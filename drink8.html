      <br>
      <br>
      Iced coffee is pretty much what the name says. Literally coffee that's been cooled with a whole lot of ice. This is actually one of the few non-confusing coffee type names out there.
    
      <br><br>
      Depending on who you ask, iced coffee may use several types of coffee - as in, brew styles.
      
      <br><br>
      You'll find iced coffee made with espresso, drip filter, Chemex, Aeropress, anything.

      <br><br>
      Most commonly, it's espresso based.

      <br><br>
      Not because it's better, but it's the strongest tasting version and the ice's really going to water the whole thing down.

    </p>

    <p class="drink-info1">
      According to some sources, the origins of iced coffee can be traced back to 17th century Vienna, where citizens experimented with new brewing methods after a departing Turkish army left behind a massive surplus in coffee beans. Others claim that the first iced coffee, famously known as Mazagran, originated in Algeria. This original version of the iced coffee was fundamentally a different type of coffee, as it was given to French soldiers during the Battle of Mazagran to keep them chilled and refreshed. Frozen coffee beverages, similar to slush, are also documented in the 19th century.
      <br><br>
      Despite the various claims, it is clear that iced coffee has a rich history with roots in different parts of the world. As the popularity of this beverage continues to grow, it is important to understand its origins and how it has evolved over time.
